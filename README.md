# Supervised-Learning
This project is part of CSE 574 - Introduction to Machine Learning

**Project Overview:**
The goal of the project is to perform classification using machine learning. In the 
first part of the project, I have performed Data Pre-processing. Then, I trained the 
model using gradient descent for logistic regression and calculated the accuracy by 
tested the model on the testing set. Later I implemented Neural networks using 
different regularization methods and then calculated accuracy for each of them.

**Dataset:**
To implement machine learning models with Pima Indian Diabetes dataset with 768 
samples, I have split the data samples as Training, Validation and Testing, each 
constituting of 60%, 20% and 20% respectively of the overall data. Training dataset 
has 460 samples, Validation dataset has 154 samples and Testing dataset has 154 
samples.

**Python Editor:**
I have used Jupiter Notebook on Google Collab for implementation and shared.
